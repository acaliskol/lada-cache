/**
 * Reads StatsCounter-produced `lada:stats:*` hourly HASH buckets and aggregates
 * activity counts per (table, action) across a recent time window.
 *
 * Used by {@see \Spiritix\LadaCache\Console\CalibrateCommand} to enrich the
 * OBJECT IDLETIME signal with read / write frequency before computing a
 * per-model TTL.
 *
 * Returned shape per table:
 *   [
 *     'hit'        => int,  // cache HIT count
 *     'miss'       => int,  // cache MISS count (DB query executed)
 *     'invalidate' => int,  // tag/key invalidation count (writes to that table)
 *   ]
 *
 * Bucket key format: `lada:stats:YYYYMMDDHH` (the same wall-clock format
 * StatsCounter uses on write). Missing buckets contribute 0 — pipelined
 * HGETALL returns an empty array for non-existent keys, which is benign.
 *
 * Failure semantics: Redis/pipeline exceptions are NOT swallowed here. The
 * caller ({@see CalibrateCommand::loadActivity()}) is responsible for catching
 * them so it can distinguish a real Redis failure ("idletime_only" fallback)
 * from a genuinely empty bucket window ("no_activity"). Swallowing at this
 * layer would collapse both into a misleading no_activity classification and
 * hide operational issues from the cron summary log + monitoring.
 *
 * Octane-safe: no mutable instance state beyond the constructor dependency.
