## Architecture

Lada Cache integrates with Laravel’s database layer by registering a Lada-aware connection, which returns a custom query builder to intercept and cache SQL operations automatically.

**Query lifecycle:**
1. Intercept query → Reflector analyzes SQL, bindings, and affected tables.  
2. Compute cache key → Based on SQL + parameters + database.  
3. Lookup in Redis → If cached, return immediately.  
4. Execute + store → If not cached, execute query and store result.  
5. Auto-invalidate → On any insert, update, delete, or truncate.  

The result is **automatic, consistent caching** across all database operations.

## Performance

Real-world gains range from **5% to 95%**, depending on how many and how complex your queries are. Typical Laravel apps see **~10–30%** faster responses and a **significant drop in DB load**.

- Large payloads still cost to move/encode; e.g. a query returning ~500MB won’t get faster from caching alone.
- The more redundant and complex the queries per request, the bigger the benefit.
- Reduced database traffic can translate to lower infra cost and easier horizontal scaling.

## Why?

- **Database-heavy apps** (especially with Eloquent) often repeat the same queries and not all are efficient.
- **RDBMS internal caches** (e.g., MySQL Query Cache) have hard limits:
  - Do not cache multi-table queries (joins)
  - **Coarse invalidation** (row change can evict a whole table)
  - **Not distributed** across DB servers
  - **Poor scalability** under load
- **Laravel manual caching** requires manual invalidation or time-based expiry.

Lada Cache provides automated, granular, distributed caching with transparent invalidation and scale-out via Redis.

## Why only Redis?

- Requires **in-memory** storage for latency and throughput.
- Must be **easily scalable** and **distributed**.
- Needs **tagging** support for granular invalidation (Laravel Cache tags exist but are slow for this use case).

Therefore, Lada Cache builds directly on top of Laravel Redis. If you need another backend, contributions are welcome.

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require spiritix/lada-cache
```

Lada Cache registers itself automatically via **Laravel Package Discovery**.

Then, publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spiritix\LadaCache\LadaCacheServiceProvider"
```

Finally, ensure all your Eloquent models include the trait:

```php
use Spiritix\LadaCache\Database\LadaCacheTrait;

class Car extends Model
{
    use LadaCacheTrait;
}
```

> 💡 It’s best to add the trait in a shared `BaseModel` class that all models extend.

## Configuration
After publishing the configuration file (see [Installation](#installation)), you will find a comprehensive config file at `config/lada-cache.php`.

This file allows you to fine-tune cache behavior, such as:
- Enabling or disabling Lada Cache globally  
- Setting key prefixes and expiration times  
- Defining which tables to include or exclude from caching  
- Enabling Debugbar integration for cache inspection  

The default configuration is already optimized for most Laravel applications, so you typically won’t need to modify it unless you want more granular control.

## Usage

After installation, Lada Cache works **automatically**.  
No code changes or caching calls are required - all database queries are transparently cached and invalidated.

You can control global behavior via `.env`:

```env
LADA_CACHE_ACTIVE=true
LADA_CACHE_DEBUGBAR=true
```

## Console Commands

```bash
# Flush all cached entries
php artisan lada-cache:flush

# Temporarily disable cache
php artisan lada-cache:disable

# Re-enable cache
php artisan lada-cache:enable

# Auto-calibrate per-model TTLs from Redis OBJECT IDLETIME (see Auto-calibration below)
php artisan lada-cache:calibrate              # dry-run
php artisan lada-cache:calibrate --apply      # persist results
```

## Auto-calibration

Picking the right TTL per model is a guessing game without production data.
`lada-cache:calibrate` removes the guesswork: it samples Redis `OBJECT IDLETIME`
for cached keys belonging to each Lada-cached model, computes the P95 idle
time, and derives a per-model TTL via:

```
calibrated_ttl = max(ceil(P95 * safety_factor), floor(previous_ttl / 2))
```

The floor term protects against survivor bias — `OBJECT IDLETIME` can only
sample keys that haven't yet been evicted, so successive runs would otherwise
shrink TTLs monotonically toward zero.

Results are stored in the `lada_cache_calibrations` table (shipped via package
migration) and consumed by `TtlResolver` between the `HasLadaTtl` interface
and the static `model_ttls` config map.

### Enable

```env
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_ENABLED=true        # default: false
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_SAFETY_FACTOR=2.0   # P95 multiplier
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_MIN_SAMPLES=50      # skip models with fewer samples
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_CACHE_TTL=300       # in-memory map cache, seconds
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_SCHEDULE="0 3 * * 0"  # cron — empty string = no auto-schedule
```

Then publish & run the package migration:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=migrations
php artisan migrate
```

### Auto-scheduled cron

The package auto-registers the calibration cron via
`callAfterResolving(Schedule::class)` when both `enabled=true` and `schedule`
(a cron expression) are set. The default schedule is **every Sunday at 03:00**
(`0 3 * * 0`) — long enough for TTLs to converge on real access patterns
without bombing Redis with daily scans.

To customise, override `LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_SCHEDULE` with any cron
expression, or set it to an empty string and register the command yourself:

```php
// routes/console.php (Laravel 11+) or app/Console/Kernel.php
Schedule::command('lada-cache:calibrate --apply')->weekly();
```

The auto-registered job runs with `->onOneServer()`, `->withoutOverlapping()`,
and `->runInBackground()` — safe under multi-server Horizon deployments.

### Safety

- Refuses to run when Redis `maxmemory-policy` is `*-lfu` (IDLETIME is
  unsupported under LFU eviction — using it would calibrate every TTL
  toward zero).
- Dry-run by default; `--apply` is required to mutate `lada_cache_calibrations`.
- Skips models with fewer than `min_samples` data points (including 0).
- Pipelined `OBJECT IDLETIME` calls and cursor-driven `SSCAN`/`SCAN` keep
  the command non-blocking even against millions of cached keys.

## Stats / Activity Counter

Lada Cache can publish a `LadaCacheActivity` event on every cache hit, miss,
and invalidate. The event is **opt-in** — disabled by default so unused
installs incur zero overhead on the query hot path.

```env
LADA_CACHE_EVENTS_ENABLED=true
```

The event carries the action (`hit`/`miss`/`invalidate`), the cache key, the
tags, and the primary table — letting you wire any listener you like (Prometheus
exporter, structured log line, custom counter…).

### Bundled StatsCounter listener

For the common "count per-table activity over time" case, the package ships a
buffered listener that writes hourly HASH buckets to Redis:

```env
LADA_CACHE_EVENTS_ENABLED=true
LADA_CACHE_STATS_ENABLED=true
```

```
lada:stats:YYYYMMDDHH
  field "users:hit"        → 42819
  field "users:miss"       → 512
  field "users:invalidate" → 120
  ...
```

Buckets self-evict via TTL (default 7 days). The counter aggregates in process
memory and flushes when distinct (table:action) keys exceed
`flush_max_batch`, when `flush_max_seconds` elapses since the last flush, or
when the application terminates — works under FPM, Octane, queue workers, and
the scheduler.

### Activity-aware calibration

When the StatsCounter is enabled, `lada-cache:calibrate` enriches its IDLETIME
signal with read / write counts from the last `stats_lookback_hours` and labels
each model with a signal source:

| Signal | When | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| `idletime_only` | StatsReader unavailable or Redis lookup failed | Original IDLETIME-only TTL |
| `no_activity` | reads + writes below `min_reads_for_signal` | Original IDLETIME-only TTL |
| `write_heavy` | invalidates / (hits+misses) ≥ `write_heavy_ratio` | Skip survivor-bias floor (writes were going to invalidate anyway) |
| `read_heavy` | otherwise | Hit-ratio proportional control toward `target_hit_ratio` |

Tuning knobs (all `LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_*` env vars):

```env
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_STATS_LOOKBACK_HOURS=168      # 7 days
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_MIN_READS_FOR_SIGNAL=10
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_WRITE_HEAVY_RATIO=0.5
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_TARGET_HIT_RATIO=0.80
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_HIT_RATIO_DEADBAND=0.05
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_HIT_RATIO_LEARNING_RATE=0.30
LADA_CACHE_CALIBRATION_HIT_RATIO_MAX_STEP=0.20
```

The calibration log line includes per-signal counters so you can graph the
distribution of read-heavy vs write-heavy models across runs.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Multiple connections (`DB::connection('foo')`) are only supported when using Lada’s connection integration. Models defining `$connection` work automatically.  
- Third-party packages with custom query builders may bypass caching.
- Complex SQL constructs such as `UNION`/`INTERSECT`/advanced expressions may not be fully reflected for row-level tagging; invalidation falls back to table-level tags.
- Raw SQL executed directly via the connection (e.g., `DB::select()`, `DB::statement()`) is not cached by design.
- Row-level tagging relies on standard single-column primary keys. Composite or unconventional primary keys fall back to table-level invalidation.
